# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview

Welcome to the CPU Scheduling Simulator project! This project provides a simulation environment for various CPU scheduling algorithms, including Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF) Scheduling, Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling, and AG Scheduling (a custom scheduling algorithm).

## Algorithms

### Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF)
This algorithm selects the process with the shortest burst time first. It aims to minimize the total processing time and provides an efficient solution for minimizing waiting times.

### Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF) Scheduling
SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF where the scheduler selects the process with the shortest remaining time. This helps in minimizing the waiting time and increases overall system throughput. The simulator addresses the starvation problem in SRTF.

### Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling
This algorithm selects the process with the highest priority first. To solve the starvation problem, aging is implemented, where the priority of waiting processes increases over time.

### AG Scheduling
AG Scheduling is a custom scheduling algorithm designed specifically for this simulator. It follows a unique logic to allocate CPU time to processes.
